# DEEP-LEARNING-STOCK-PREDICTION

# Overview
This project focuses on utilizing deep learning techniques, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, to predict stock prices. By analyzing historical stock price data, this project aims to provide users with accurate and informed predictions for making investment decisions.

Stock Price Prediction

# Motivation
The stock market is inherently volatile and influenced by a multitude of factors. Predicting stock prices is a challenging task that can benefit investors, traders, and financial analysts. Deep learning, with its ability to capture intricate patterns in data, presents a promising approach for stock price forecasting.

# Methodology
Data Collection
To start, historical stock price data is collected. This data typically includes information such as opening prices, closing prices, daily highs and lows, adjusted close prices, and trading volumes. The data can be obtained from various sources, including financial APIs, web scraping, or historical datasets.

# Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step. Raw data is often noisy and may require cleaning and transformation. This phase involves handling missing data, normalizing values, and structuring the data to be fed into the deep learning model.

# Model Training
The heart of the project lies in training a deep learning model, specifically an LSTM network. This model learns from historical data patterns and relationships between variables. It involves defining the architecture, hyperparameter tuning, and training the model on historical stock price data.

# Making Predictions
Once the model is trained, it is capable of making predictions. This is typically done by feeding a sequence of past data into the model and obtaining forecasts for future stock prices. The predicted prices can be used to inform investment decisions.

# Results
The success of the stock price prediction model can be measured using various evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Additionally, visualizations, including actual vs. predicted price graphs, can provide insights into the model's performance.
